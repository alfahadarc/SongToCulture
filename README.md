## 🎶 Song to Culture: Unveiling Global Music Trends

Music is a universal language that reflects and shapes culture. The objective of this project, **"Song to Culture,"** is to utilize **interactive data visualization** to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within global music data.

By bridging raw **audio features**, **lyrical content**, and **metadata**, we aim to provide an immersive narrative on how musical attributes correlate with cultural phenomena (such as emotion, location, and popularity).
